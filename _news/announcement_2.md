Petex2024 abstract accepted

---

I am pleased to announce that my Petex 2024 abstract has been accepted. The paper, titled Advancements in Seismic Data Acquisition and Processing: The First Broadband 3D Marine Vibrator Survey in the North Sea". 

We present the results of the processing and imaging of marine vibrator (MV) alpha test data recently acquired at the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea. The alpha test includes a 3D survey using a single MV across a frequency spectrum of 3-150Hz and additional testing of several 2D source-lines using two MVs. Moreover, two ultra-low frequency (ULF) test lines were conducted over a 1-8Hz frequency range. The preliminary processing results of the 3D survey are on par with those derived from the legacy airgun array acquisition, thereby affirming the viability of employing MV technology on a large scale.

The abstract has been prepared with contributions from my esteemed colleagues Arash Jafargandomi, Kara Howard, Sergio Grion and Alysa Evensen at Shearwater Geoservices. We are looking forward to sharing our findings with the global community and engaging in fruitful discussions at the conference.

Thank you to everyone who supported this research. More details will follow upon acceptance of our work.
