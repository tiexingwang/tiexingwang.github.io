EAGE2025 abstract titled "Interpolating Sparse Seismic Data via Horizon-Guided Inverse Distance Weighting" submitted

---

I am pleased to announce that the paper, titled *"Interpolating Sparse Seismic Data via Horizon-Guided Inverse Distance Weighting,"* has been submitted for the upcoming [EAGE2025](https://eageannual.org/). 
This study presents a method that combines inverse distance weighting (IDW) with pre-defined horizons to guide the interpolation process and ensure geological consistency. By leveraging horizon information, the proposed method effectively fills large gaps in 2D seismic data and generates a 3D seismic data volume, preserving structural continuity across the seismic volume.

This is a joint work with my colleagues Dr. Robert Telling, Dr. Sebastian Holland, Dr. Javier Martin, Dr. Arash Jafargandomi. We are looking forward to sharing our findings with the global community and engaging in fruitful discussions at the conference. Thank you to everyone who supported this research. More details will follow upon acceptance of our work.
