GET2024 abstract accepted

---

I am pleased to announce that the paper, titled "What Can Generative Modelling Do for Interpolation of Extremely Sparse Wind Farm Seismic Data?", has been accepted for the upcoming Global Energy Transition Conference 2024.  By manually decimating 90% of the traces in each image, we tested interpolation performance by using two deep learning strategies: deep generative modelling and classical deep supervised learning.

The abstract has been prepared with contributions from my esteemed colleagues Arash Jafargandomi, Rob Telling at Shearwater Geoservices and Dr Jing Sun at Delft University of Technology. We are looking forward to sharing our findings with the global community and engaging in fruitful discussions at the conference.

Thank you to everyone who supported this research. More details will follow upon acceptance of our work.
