EAGE2025 abstract submitted

---

I am pleased to announce that the paper, titled *"Physics-Driven Self-Supervised Deep Learning for Free-Surface Multiple Elimination,"* has been submitted for the upcoming [EAGE2025](https://eageannual.org/). Rather than using the supervised learning approach to remove multiples, we propose a method in which the deep learning model learns to effectively parameterize the free-surface multiple-free wavefield from the full wavefield by incorporating the underlying physics into the loss computation.

This is a joint work with [Dr. Jing Sun](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/people/jing-sun) and [Dr. Eric Verschuur](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/d.j.verschuur/) from Delft University of Technology and my colleague [Dr. Ivan Vasconcelos](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/ivan-vasconcelos-9166085). We are looking forward to sharing our findings with the global community and engaging in fruitful discussions at the conference.

Thank you to everyone who supported this research. More details will follow upon acceptance of our work.
