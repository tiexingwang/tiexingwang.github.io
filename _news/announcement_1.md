EAGE2025 abstract submitted

---

I am pleased to announce that the paper, titled "Physics-Driven Self-Supervised Deep Learning for Free-Surface Multiple Elimination," has been submitted for the upcoming <a href="https://eageannual.org/">EAGE2025</a>. Unlike traditional supervised learning approaches that require labeled training data, our method incorporates the underlying physics directly into the loss computation, allowing the model to self-supervise its learning process.

This is a joint effort with <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/people/jing-sun">Dr. Jing Sun</a> and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/d.j.verschuur/">Dr. Eric Verschuur</a> from Delft University of Technology, and my colleague <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/ivan-vasconcelos-9166085">Dr. Ivan Vasconcelos</a>. We are excited to share our findings with the global community and look forward to engaging in insightful discussions at the conference.

Thank you to everyone who supported this research. More details will follow upon acceptance of our work.
