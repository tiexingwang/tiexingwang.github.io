Tiexing Wang is a research geophysicist on the R&D team at <a href="https://www.shearwatergeo.com/">**Shearwater GeoServices**</a>, United Kingdom.

His main research areas are **physics-ML**, **seismic signal processing & inversion** and **Generative modelling**. He is particularly focused on building a **physics-aware framework** that eliminates the need for supervised learning with ground truth data. This framework aims to be a reliable solver for inverse problems.

He is also a board member of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eage-local-chapter-london-450713139/?originalSubdomain=uk">**EAGE London Local Chapter**</a> and the <a href="https://eage.org/communities/young-professionals/">**EAGE Young Professionals Committee**</a>, where he promotes scientific research and addresses scientific challenges during the energy transition.
